Don't get disappointed so soon. There is indeed a way to avoid this. If the three bodies are of comparable mass, and one of the bodies is situated at L4 or L5, tuning the orbital parameters may work just fine, but then you gotta worry about tidal forces. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/qn5Mn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lagrange points&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if the size of our third star exceeds the area given to it at L4/L5, it will experience tidal forces and will start ejecting mass to either of the two other stars, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as Zolan commented above, astronomy with an infinite universe has a possibility for everything.

If the Sun and Earth were&#xA;  the only things in the solar system, our planet's orbit would be an&#xA;  ellipse of virtually constant shape and orientation in space. However,&#xA;  because the other planets pull on Earth, our orbit does change&#xA;  slightly over time, in orientation and in shape. Same for the other&#xA;  planets' orbits. The biggest effect is that the orbit of a planet&#xA;  (which is nearly exaclty an ellipse) gradually shifts its orientation&#xA;  over time: the shifting is like how a circular hula-hoop (representing&#xA;  the orbit) shifts in location around the hula-hooper as the person&#xA;  shakes their hips (ask your teacher what a hula-hoop is). But the&#xA;  shifting of a planet's orbit is much slower than for the hula hoop. It&#xA;  takes many, many centuries for the Earth's orbit to shift entirely&#xA;  around once. These changes would be slow and small. It is an active&#xA;  area of research whether or not the orbiting objects in the solar&#xA;  system can indefinitely orbit the Sun without ever undergoing&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;drastic&lt;/em&gt; changes in their orbits --- they may actually change dramatically at some point: such changes would be called &quot;chaotic&quot; and&#xA;  the area of research is called &quot;chaos theory&quot;. No new forces would be&#xA;  necessary to make this possibility happen; it would simply be the&#xA;  application of gravity once again. There are known examples of chaotic&#xA;  behavior in the solar system, but only involving a few small objects&#xA;  orbiting the outer planets, or in the asteroid belt. Chaotic behavior&#xA;  is defined as happening when very small differences in the initial or&#xA;  current conditions of an experiment, or of the solar system's motions&#xA;  (perhaps so small as to not be easily measured), would lead to&#xA;  drastically different results later in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Besides the planets in the solar system, it is even possible (over a&#xA;  much longer time scale) for a passing neighbor star to cause small&#xA;  changes in the planets' orbits. That's actually how comets, which&#xA;  otherwise have large orbits that never take them near the Sun, are&#xA;  caused to change orbit and pass near the Sun, allowing us to see them.&#xA;  If the incoming comet passes near Jupiter, it may be permanently moved&#xA;  into a small orbit that will keep it repeatedly passing near the Sun&#xA;  (once every 75 years, or so, for Halley's comet, for example). An&#xA;  example of chaos: in this case, if Jupiter is in just a slightly&#xA;  different position when the comet passes during its first fall toward&#xA;  the Sun, the comet may not end up in a small orbit due to Jupiter's&#xA;  gravitational pull, but may instead end up hitting the Sun! Or it&#xA;  might be &quot;ejected&quot; from the solar system entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/astronomy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="69" LastEditorUserId="19" LastEditDate="2013-09-26T23:28:04.813" LastActivityDate="2013-09-26T23:28:04.813" CommentCount="0" />

It is true that if an observer&#xA;  (A) is stationary near the event horizon of a black hole, and a second&#xA;  observer (B) is stationary at great distance from the event horizon,&#xA;  then B will see A's clock to be ticking slow, and A will see B's clock&#xA;  to be ticking fast. But if A falls down toward the event horizon&#xA;  (eventually crossing it) while B remains stationary, then what each&#xA;  sees is not as straight forward as the above situation suggests. As B&#xA;  sees things: A falls toward the event horizon, photons from A take&#xA;  longer and longer to climb out of the &quot;gravtiational well&quot; leading to&#xA;  the apparent slowing down of A's clock as seen by B, and when A is at&#xA;  the horizon, any photon emitted by A's clock takes (formally) an&#xA;  infinite time to get out to B. Imagine that each person's clock emits&#xA;  one photon for each tick of the clock, to make it easy to think about.&#xA;  Thus, A appears to freeze, as seen by B, just as you say. However, A&#xA;  has crossed the event horizon! It is only an illusion (literally an&#xA;  &quot;optical&quot; illusion) that makes B think A never crosses the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As A sees things: A falls, and crosses the horizon (in perhaps a very&#xA;  short time). A sees B's clock emitting photons, but A is rushing away&#xA;  from B, and so never gets to collect more than a finite number of&#xA;  those photons before crossing the event horizon. (If you wish, you can&#xA;  think of this as due to a cancellation of the gravitational time&#xA;  dilation by a doppler effect --- due to the motion of A away from B).&#xA;  After crossing the event horizon, the photons coming in from above are&#xA;  not easily sorted out by origin, so A cannot figure out how B's clock&#xA;  continued to tick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A finite number of photons were emitted by A before A crossed the&#xA;  horizon, and a finite number of photons were emitted by B (and&#xA;  collected by A) before A crossed the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You might ask What if A were to be lowered ever so slowly toward the&#xA;  event horizon? Yes, then the doppler effect would not come into play,&#xA;  UNTIL, at some practical limit, A got too close to the horizon and&#xA;  would not be able to keep from falling in. Then A would only see a&#xA;  finite total of photons form B (but now a larger number --- covering&#xA;  more of B's time). Of course, if A &quot;hung on&quot; long enough before&#xA;  actually falling in, then A might see the future course of the&#xA;  universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: simply falling into a black hole won't give you a view of&#xA;  the entire future of the universe. Black holes can exist without being&#xA;  part of the final big crunch, and matter can fall into black holes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For a very nice discussion of black holes for non-scientists, see Kip&#xA;  Thorne's book: Black Holes and Time Warps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/blackholes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="69" LastEditorUserId="19" LastEditDate="2013-09-26T23:33:43.720" LastActivityDate="2013-09-26T23:33:43.720" CommentCount="0" />

When I want to point out a particular object in the sky (say Polaris, the North Star), I start by pointing out a familiar constellation (say &lt;em&gt;Ursa Major&lt;/em&gt;, the Big Dipper).

In order to include all stars, the sky is divided into irregular regions that encompass the familiar constellations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, which constellations is the Sun assigned to?  Well, from the perspective of someone on the Earth, the Sun moves through the constellations throughout the course of the year.  Or rather, Sol moves through the region of the sky where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology#The_zodiac&quot;&gt;some of the constellations&lt;/a&gt; would be seen if its light did not drown out distant stars.  Our moon and the rest of the planets move through those same constellations.  (The Greek phrase which gives us the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet&quot;&gt;&quot;planet&quot;&lt;/a&gt; means &quot;wandering star&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current position of the sun against the background of distant stars changes over the course of the year.

Conservation of angular momentum means that an initially slow-rotating core becomes a rapidly spinning neutron star, which also drives a dynamo action that generates a strong magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The emission from a neutron star comes as a result of pair-production in its magnetosphere, which has an approximately dipolar shape and thus the strongest field strength at its poles. This field is rarely aligned with the spin axis, thus giving the &quot;lighthouse&quot; effect where the beam sweeps over an observer at twice the spin frequency. These pair-produced particles radiate energy via synchrotron emission (primarily in the radio), sapping energy from the magnetic field. As the neutron star ages, the magnetic field eventually decays below a critical point where electrons/positrons cannot be pair-produced.

It's also very thin. The reason why a disk forms is largely thought to be due to slight asymmetries in the accretion of material early on in the galaxy's history. Over time, and due to conservation of angular momentum, the material collapses down into a disk. Incidentally, this is where the sun lives. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/QxNbg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of galactic components.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That ribbon is the disk of the Milky Way. It looks cloudy because of the dust and gas which scatters light from the rest of the galaxy. The reason why gas accumulates here is because as things begin to collapse into a disk, the gas collides with itself, and sort of 'sticks' together. In other words, where a bunch of stars may very happily pass through a bunch of other stars without many of them colliding or being disturbed, gas has a much harder time doing this.

However, usually after lining up the primary mirror the secondary mirror no longer seemed to be lined up and I need to do the secondary mirror all over again.

Titan's atmosphere is about 1.19 times as massive as Earth's overall, or about 7.3 times more massive on a per surface area basis. It supports opaque haze layers that block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and renders Titan's surface features obscure. The atmosphere is so thick and the gravity so low that humans could fly through it by flapping &quot;wings&quot; attached to their arms. Titan's lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth's; even at a distance of 975 km, the Cassini spacecraft had to make adjustments to maintain a stable orbit against atmospheric drag. The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from the outside. It was not until the arrival of the Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004 that the first direct images of Titan's surface were obtained. The Huygens probe was unable to detect the direction of the Sun during its descent, and although it was able to take images from the surface, the Huygens team likened the process to &quot;taking pictures of an asphalt parking lot at dusk&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19" LastActivityDate="2013-09-25T18:48:37.547" CommentCount="0" />

At this time, the Universe was in an extremely hot and dense state and began expanding rapidly. After the initial expansion, the Universe cooled sufficiently to allow energy to be converted into various subatomic particles, including protons, neutrons, and electrons.

Because grazing transits are not easily detected, those with a duration less than half of a central transit are ignored. Since a chord equal to half the diameter is at a distance of 0.866 of the radius from the center of a circle, the usable transits account for 86.6% of the total. If other planetary systems are similar to our solar system in that they also contain two Earth-size planets in inner orbits, and since the orbits are not co-planar to within $2d_*/D$, the probabilities can be added. Thus, approximately $0.011 \times 0.866$ $= 1\%$ of the solar-like stars with planets should show Earth-size transits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty freaking amazing!

Let's star with a solar type star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a typical solar type star, the formation time is about 10 million years (you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3aFormation_stellaire_Andre_1994.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt; on Wikimedia that gives an overview of the star formation process, adapted from Philippe André's figure in &lt;em&gt;Observations of protostars and protostellar stages&lt;/em&gt; in The cold Universe, 1994). You can distinguish different epochs in the star formation process, that are the signature of different dominent physical processes. The very first stage of star formation is a gravitational collapse that leads to the formation of the protostar itself. The timescale for this collapse is the so-called &lt;strong&gt;free-fall time&lt;/strong&gt; which depends only on the density of the object. When you get a central object in a hydrostatic equilibrium, things become more subtle: the core will contract adiabatically (without heat transfer) and when a temperature of about 2000 K is reached, dihydrogene dissociated (which is a highly endothermal reaction) which lead to a second phase of collapse, leading to the formation of the protostar itself. It takes about 1000 years to get to this stage, from the hydrostatic core.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next stage, the protostellar phase, is mostly an accretion phase. It means that the timescale for this epoch is given by an &lt;strong&gt;acretion time&lt;/strong&gt;, that varies with the accreted mass (which is quite low for a solar type star). It takes about 200 000 years to accrete 90% of the final mass of the star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, since the star is still contracting, the temperature at its center is increasing; when a temperature of 1 million Kelvin is reach, the protostar starts to burn its deuterium. At this stage, the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism allows the protostar to contract and to radiate away its gravitational energy. The meaningful timescale is then the &lt;strong&gt;Kelvin-Helmholtz time&lt;/strong&gt; (which varies as the square of the mass and the inverse of the radius and the luminosity), that is much longer than the previous timescales. Temperature continues to rise, up to 10 million Kelvin, when hydrogen eventually starts to burn, which is the birth certificate of a star. It takes around 10 million years to get to this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, as I said, this scenario depends on the mass of the star. It is valid for Sun-like stars, but quite not for massive stars. It is much faster for massive stars, and the star formation process is quite different. In particular, the accretion rate is much higher, the radiation pressure of the protostar is insanely higher, and their interplay is not completely understood. However, there are some theroretical works that gives an estimate of about 100 000 years to form a massive stars (see for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~jt/massivesf/massivesf.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;works from McKee and Tan&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="88" LastActivityDate="2013-09-26T09:08:52.823" CommentCount="0" />

These regimes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Lensing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strong lensing is the most visually stunning form of gravitational lensing, and as its name suggests, requires an extremely massive object, and a good deal of alignment between the lens and the source. Galaxy clusters are the most common cause of strong gravitational lensing. Partial arcs, full arcs (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring&quot;&gt;Einstein rings&lt;/a&gt;), and multiple images are all strong gravitational lensing features one can observe. Some of the most commonly studied objects producing strong gravitational lensing features are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Abell_clusters&quot;&gt;Abell clusters&lt;/a&gt;, the most famous of which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_1689&quot;&gt;Abell 1689&lt;/a&gt; (image below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lbIvw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Abell 1689&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strong lensing features like arcs and rings are typically due to extended objects (like background galaxies which are not part of the cluster itself), and multiple-image (mostly quad-image systems) are typically objects like background quasars. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak Lensing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weak gravitational lensing occurs much more frequently than strong lensing. Lenses can be clusters (in their outer regions), individual galaxies, or even large scale structure in the universe. Weak lensing is not a noticeable effect by eye, rather, it has to be done statistically. Ellipticities of a &lt;em&gt;field&lt;/em&gt; of background galaxies are observed on a grid, and are statistically averaged together to create the weak lensing signal. Shape distortions of these background galaxies due to lensing are on the percent scale. One important assumption is made, however, and that is that galaxies' isophotes (lines of constant light) are elliptical, and their orientations are completely random. With that, any &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; tangential shearing produced is due to gravitational lensing. In the image below (from upper left to bottom right), the upper left frame shows an unlensed field of circular galaxies, and to its immediate right shows the effect of lensing. The image in the bottom right has added shape noise (a 'realistic' field of background galaxies), and to its right is how the field would lens.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jXnUj.png&quot; alt=&quot;WL Field.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, higher order shape distortion effects, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~goldberg/flexion/&quot;&gt;Flexion&lt;/a&gt;, can produce the extended galaxy sources to not only shear, but to flex. This is currently a tough thing to measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microlensing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microlensing is a regime of lensing which is most common on the scale of the Milky Way galaxy. This can occur when background stars pass behind foreground stars. Microlensing is actually strong enough to produce multiple images of the background star, but since the image separations are so small (micro-arcsecond scale - hence the name), what we observe (since an angular resolution of a micro-arcsecond is tough to achieve)  is a change in the flux as the object moves into and out of alignment with the intermediate massive object. Interestingly, microlensing has actually proven useful in detecting planets around stellar lensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/B75do.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microlensing Planet&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="45" LastActivityDate="2013-09-26T14:18:49.667" CommentCount="0" />

From there, I can tell my friend to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~huffman/finddip.html&quot;&gt;follow this or that line&lt;/a&gt; to get them to look where I'm looking:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/oWCZr.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Finding the North Star&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the advent of computerized telescopes and large data sets, constellations are less important for professional astronomers.  However, many stellar databases use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamsteed_designation&quot;&gt;Flamsteed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_designation&quot;&gt;Bayer&lt;/a&gt; designations, which assign stars to constellations.  In order to include all stars, the sky is divided into irregular regions that encompass the familiar constellations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, which constellations is the Sun assigned to?  Well, from the perspective of someone on the Earth, the Sun moves through the constellations throughout the course of the year.  Or rather, Sol moves through the region of the sky where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology#The_zodiac&quot;&gt;some of the constellations&lt;/a&gt; would be seen if its light did not drown out distant stars.  Our moon and the rest of the planets move through those same constellations.  (The Greek phrase which gives us the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet&quot;&gt;&quot;planet&quot;&lt;/a&gt; means &quot;wandering star&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current position of the sun against the background of distant stars changes over the course of the year.  (This is important for &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/starfinder2/&quot;&gt;astrology&lt;/a&gt;.)  It's a little easier to make sense of with a diagram:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/vku1F.gif&quot; alt=&quot;How the sun is aligned with a particular constellation.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So perhaps a better question is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/starfinder3/&quot;&gt;What constellation does the Sun belong to &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presumably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/starmaps/alienskies.php&quot;&gt;an observer on an exoplanet&lt;/a&gt; would assign Sol to some constellation that is convenient from her perspective.  But from our perspective within the Solar system our sun, moon, and planets are not part of any constellation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48" LastEditorUserId="48" LastEditDate="2013-09-27T20:06:48.880" LastActivityDate="2013-09-27T20:06:48.880" CommentCount="3" />

The first is the light collecting power of the telescope, which is simply a measure of how many photons the telescope can collect from an object. This, not surprisingly, is affected by the size of the primary mirror/lens of the telescope. The second issue is the telescope's angular resolution, which is a measure of the level of detail which can be seen within an image. Telescopes on the surface of the Earth have to worry about the atmosphere, which due to its non-uniformity causes blurring and smearing of images (this contributes significantly to what's known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function&quot;&gt;point spread function&lt;/a&gt;). The HST is in space to avoid atmospheric effects, and thus, it achieves higher angular resolution by doing so. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="45" LastEditorUserId="45" LastEditDate="2013-10-28T16:01:14.660" LastActivityDate="2013-10-28T16:01:14.660" CommentCount="0" />

Additionally, the mass can be determined through dynamics. If you combine these two, under the assumption that the star is in a state of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hydrostatic equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; (which means that the outward thermal pressure of the star due to fusion of hydrogen into helium is in balance with the inward tug of gravity), you can make statements about what the temperature and density &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be in the core. You need high densities and high temperatures in order to fuse hydrogen into helium. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember what's happening: Temperatures are hot enough for hydrogen in the core to be completely ionized, meaning that in order to fuse these protons into helium nuclei, you need to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion as two protons come close (like charges repel). Below is a diagram of the process of one particular type of fusion (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Proton-proton chain reaction&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4WpuY.png&quot; alt=&quot;proton-proton&quot;&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other fusion reaction which occurs at the cores of stars is called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNO_cycle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;carbon-nitrogen-oxygen&lt;/a&gt; (CNO) cycle, and is the dominant source of energy for stars more massive than about 1.3 solar masses. Below shows this process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5UMrk.png&quot; alt=&quot;CNO&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Somebody pointed out that this doesn't actually answer the question at hand - which is true. Forgetting how to do some of the basic back of the envelope calculations myself (I admit, stellar astrophysics is definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; my specialty), I've stumbled across a &lt;em&gt;very crude&lt;/em&gt; and simple estimation of how to calculate the central pressure and temperature of the sun from. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/StarPhys/estcent.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;calculation&lt;/a&gt; does however point out the correct values and what one would need to know in order to get the details correct.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="45" LastEditorUserId="1437" LastEditDate="2014-07-16T16:38:18.537" LastActivityDate="2014-07-16T16:38:18.537" CommentCount="4" />
