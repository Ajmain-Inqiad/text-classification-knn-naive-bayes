The most recent example that I can think of is when Kawaragi Shiho, the seiyuu of Nishizono Mio from Little Busters!, got pregnant. In fact, this is very recent, as she just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2012-12-10/voice-actress-shiho-kawaragi-gives-birth-to-healthy-girl&quot;&gt;gave birth&lt;/a&gt; last Friday (December 7th). Of course Mio isn't the main character, but she's not a minor character either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, they just replaced her (with Tatsumi Yuiko). That's about the only real option they have most of the time. Unless the problem is only for a very short duration, the entire show is not going to be delayed for one seiyuu. If it happens well in advance and the character is pretty important, they can probably work around it. Gotou Yuuko (seiyuu for Hiro from Hidamari Sketch), who was on hiatus for a while this year for health reasons but is back now in Hidamari Sketch x Honeycomb, is a good example of this. However, this is a pretty atypical situation, and the other shows she was in mostly got replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, unless the character is crucially important, it's very likely that they'll get a replacement, since it's pretty much the only realistic option. If something like this happens for a popular character in the off-season, it can also affect the possibility of sequels (e.g. most shows with Aya Hirano leads probably aren't in the sequel market). It usually doesn't hurt the seiyuu's career too much if it occurs for good reasons e.g. health, but some impact is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastActivityDate="2012-12-11T22:34:58.657" CommentCount="2" />

Let's not forget that alongside the original ending of Angel Beats, Key issued another epilogue, aptly titled &quot;Another Epilogue&quot;. In this, the main focus is another person that's arrived in the Afterlife, and he is surrounded by quiet, obedient NPCs. After challenging the reality of the Afterlife School, he is talked to by the Student Council President,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; The Otonashi in an alternate timeline, who hasn't moved on yet,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and he is told that if he has any questions about the world that they both live in that he should come down to the Student Council room. However, as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Otonashi heads back to the Student Council room, a girl can be heard saying, &quot;There's a rumor that he's waiting for someone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So therefore, it's entirely possible that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Otonashi is waiting for Kanade, and that this timestream somehow loops. Otonashi goes crazy waiting for Kanade, who has a infinitesimally small chance of reappearing in the Afterlife, but still, better than zero. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He turns himself into an NPC to be able to withstand the long wait, and creates the AI, or the &quot;AI&quot; to be able to maintain the requirements of the Afterlife, not allowing love to manifest, possibly therefore saving future arrivals from the pain that he has been exposed to. This may be why he creates &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Angel_Player&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Angelplayer&lt;/a&gt;, because he knows that if Kanade reappears, then she'll know how to use it, any maybe program it to move him back from his NPC state. The members of the SSS arrive after this, then, at the time of Episode 1, the timestream loops, causing &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Otonashi to revert back from an NPC. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgetting everything that's happened to him, the events continue their course the same way they did before – &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; causing the timeline to repeat over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2.

Gotou Yuuko (seiyuu for Hiro from Hidamari Sketch), who was on hiatus for a while this year for health reasons but is back now in Hidamari Sketch x Honeycomb, is a good example of this.

From the beginnings, when you're getting explained how the players are divided:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Inside the city, or the places mostly referred to as «Safe Areas», there was protection implemented by the system and players couldn't hurt each other. But it wasn't like that outside. The stragglers made teams with other stragglers and ambushed other players —which was in many ways much more profitable than hunting monsters— out on the fields or the labyrinth areas. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Players that commit crimes are marked orange (i.e., their cursor turns orange). From when Kirito and Asuna encounter the troop from The Army in the forest:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;More importantly, whenever a player committed a crime, their cursor would turn orange and wouldn't turn back to green for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that attacking an orange player doesn't change your cursor to orange. From when Asuna steps in to stop Kuradeel from killing Kirito:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Kuradeel bounced back up as if he had springs and attempted to form an excuse with his nervous voice. But before he could finish, Asuna's right hand flashed and the tip of her sword tore Kuradeel's mouth. She didn't become a criminal since her opponent already had an orange cursor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inside of towns, you have the town protection in place, which doesn't allow open PvP, so many new players originally stayed in town to be safe. You can attack other people in towns, but it won't do anything except for some special shiny effects and knockback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If players engage in duels, there are several options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First Strike Mode - from the duel against Kuradeel:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I nodded in reply, then pressed Yes and chose the «First Strike Mode» from the options. This was a duel that could be won either by landing the first clean hit or by reducing the opponent's HP to half.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete Decisive Mode - from the Inner Area PK incident:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, there were still some loopholes around this rule. One of them is when the player's sleeping. There are times when players, with their energy exhausted through long durations of battle, are basically unconscious when they go into a deep sleep, and unable to wake up even with some stimulations. With that opportunity, one could raise a request to duel in «Complete Decisive Mode» and moved the sleeping opponent's finger to press on the OK button. All that was left was to literally make the opponent sleep like the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other options are not explained or mentioned as far as I can see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the ALO arc, there's PvP against other fairy races in your native race's (controlled) towns. From when Lyfa/Suguha shows Kirito around meeting Sigurd:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Somehow, a circle of onlookers had already surrounded them, drawn by the signs of trouble. If this was a formal duel, or if he were an actual Spriggan spy, then fine. But it would be dishonorable if Sigurd instigated a fight with a tourist like Kirito, who can't even fight back in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in that same quote, it's mentioned that a &quot;formal duel&quot; is possible, but that's not further explained. Outside of towns, you can fight without restrictions. This can be seen by people just fighting about everywhere. Note that if a race's lord is killed by another race, the other race will gain control over that lord's territory. From when Lyfa explains why the Salamander want to stop the Sylphid-Cait Sith alliance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Also, if they kill the Lord, they will get some amazing bonuses. They will unconditionally receive 30% of the lord's funds stored in the mansion, and for ten days, the territory that the lord rules over would become occupied, then they are free to set taxes and take that money. That is a tremendous amount of money. The reason why Salamander became the largest force in the game was because in the past, they had set a trap for Sylph's first Lord and killed him. Normally lords don't venture into neutral territory. In the history of ALO, only one lord has ever been killed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="20" LastEditorUserId="20" LastEditDate="2013-01-29T10:00:31.947" LastActivityDate="2013-01-29T10:00:31.947" CommentCount="6" />

There is always some part of the human mind that is involved in a transmutation (otherwise, Mustang's gloves would only be able to mess with the air in a very select pattern), but in general more complicated transmutations will require a more robust &quot;hard formula&quot;.  The &quot;soft formula&quot; comes from the mind of the alchemist.  This is the part that actually shapes what should happen, while the &quot;hard formula&quot; is used to gather the required energy/ handle the heavy lifting.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of people who can transmute without circles, there are two different schools of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first follows the anime/manga rigidly, and interprets Izumi's words literally.  They see it as the 'reward' for losing part of yourself when you looked beyond the gate.  Looking beyond the gate exacts a toll from you, which is then used to &quot;pay&quot; for the privilege of seeing the base code of the universe.  Knowing this base code, alchemists are able to use the &quot;soft&quot; formula to a greater extent, and do not require the assistance of a &quot;hard&quot; formula in order to transmute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second possible explaination is more of an unintended side effect.  Remember how Barry the Chopper lost his body?  Well, his soul (in the armor) was able to sense his body's presence (and vice-versa).  If one assumes the figure at the gate (which takes peoples' body parts) is god (or at least, the source of alchemy), then him &quot;wearing&quot; an alchemists parts (pardon the term) is essentially giving that alchemist a very subtle, yet powerful connection on a mental level.  The alchemists are able to use their missing parts to bridge the gap separating them from this god-like being, and thus transmute seemingly at will.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alphonse, not having a physical body at all with which to form a bridge, is unable to skip the &quot;hard formula&quot; at first, but upon re-visiting the experience in his own mind, he forces himself to build this &quot;bridge&quot; and can transmute naturally from then on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46" LastActivityDate="2012-12-12T02:26:25.650" CommentCount="0" />

This leaves us with both immortals traversing the world for the rest of eternity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Additional evidences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Charles grabbed Lelouch with his right hand, which had the Geass sigil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lelouch needed the fully evolved Geass to transfer a code.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The code doesn't appear to activate until someone dies. Hence, why C.C. was wounded when she first inherited her code. Same happened with Charles in the World of C.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;When Lelouch touched Nunnally, Nunnally got a flash of his memories. This ONLY happens when a high potential Geass user touches someone with the fully evolved Geass.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The title of the series is &quot;R2″, which is similar to how &quot;C.C&quot; is pronounced. So Lelouch would be &quot;R.R.&quot; which is Engrish (I presume) for L.L., Lelouch Lamprouge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;When C.C. is talking on the wagon, she says &quot;the power of Geass brings loneliness…that's not quite right is it, Lelouch?&quot; and nods her head in the direction of the wagon driver. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[Furthermore,] Orange knew of Lelouch's and Suzaku's plan and helped them out by ordering his men not to fire on Zero, he even smiled when Zero (Suzaku) jumped on his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now would Orange, a man who devoted himself entirely to Lelouche and threw away everything without a second thought be OK with a plan where the sole person he wants to protect in life is actually killed? The answer to that is NO, not even if Lelouch ordered him to accept the plan: he would not go along with it and would protect him with his life. There is only one way that Orange would be OK with a plan like that and that's if he knew about Lelouch's immortality, which I assume he did as he worked with V.V. in the Geass research base. Orange was OK with this plan as he knew Lelouch would come to no harm and would be able to start a new peaceful life with the woman he loves in a world which he himself had made peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Even at the end, we see Orange on his orange plantation, completely content with the way things have panned out, he definitely could not be that happy had Lelouch actually died. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Lelouch and CC lived happily ever after, literally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="88" LastEditorUserId="1398" LastEditDate="2015-08-01T19:50:46.027" LastActivityDate="2015-08-01T19:50:46.027" CommentCount="8" />

The series ends after the Tuatha de Danaan hijacking is resolved. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overload&lt;/strong&gt; does not follow any of the anime at all and was published as a type of side story that is not related to the anime or the light novels. &lt;strong&gt;Surplus&lt;/strong&gt; is basically the (1 volume) sequel to Overload.

Think about when you go to the movies: when the credits starts rolling, is there someone that will stay sit there? Maybe, but that's quite rare.

The key, as we know, is usually required to open the gate though which the spirit comes from the spirit world. When the gates are opened in the first time, the wizard and the spirit make an agreement (e.g. on which days should the spirit be summoned). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you look at how do the spirits react when Lucy calls them, you may notice some interesting things. For example, when she summons Aquarius, Aquarius is often disappointed with Lucy, and shortly returns to the spirit word, sometimes refusing to do what Lucy asks for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One might ask: &lt;em&gt;why in that case would the spirit even appear&lt;/em&gt;? If Aquarius is not in the mood, she could as well not appear at all, rather than be summoned and almost instantly go back (after a few insults towards Lucy, that is). That leads us to an assumption that the spirits can not actually refuse to be summoned, and possessing the key almost equals possessing the spirit's contract (they just have no other options).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some spirits, however, find benefits in working with the wizards, for example, Taurus enjoys being summoned because that way he can observe Lucy's body, which he admires. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, most of the spirits become very loyal to Lucy once she acquires their keys, so that is another argument for the assumption that possessing the key forces the spirit to make the contract and work for the wizard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastActivityDate="2012-12-12T11:50:28.500" CommentCount="5" />

Originally a Nenbutsu folk dance to welcome the spirits of the dead, the style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region. Each region has a local dance, as well as different music. The music can be songs specifically pertinent to the spiritual message of Obon, or local min'yo folk songs. Consequently, the Bon dance will look and sound different from region to region. Hokkaidō is known for a folk-song known as &quot;Soran Bushi.&quot; The song &quot;Tokyo Ondo&quot; takes its namesake from the capital of Japan. &quot;Gujo Odori&quot; in Gujō, Gifu prefecture is famous for all night dancing. &quot;Goshu Ondo&quot; is a folk song from Shiga prefecture. Residents of the Kansai area will recognize the famous &quot;Kawachi ondo.&quot; Tokushima in Shikoku is very famous for its &quot;Awa Odori,&quot; or &quot;fool's dance,&quot; and in the far south, one can hear the &quot;Ohara Bushi&quot; of Kagoshima.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Tsukihi is well known as a yukata freak who joined the tea ceremony club just to have an excuse to wear a yukata at school, and bon odori is often done in yukata.

Therefore it leads to conclusion that the government forced that choice upon him.

Therefore all these points toward my theory - that Kuma was punished for opposing the marines and an admiral from carrying out the order to purge the tenryuubito's attackers.

OR What would happen if a pokemon (just one) died instead of fainting?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are asking the first, that's a bit opinion based, but you would likely see defensive gear for pokemon to protect them more, higher regulations on battles to ensure fights don't go passed certain limits, and more medical items to help critically injured pokemon to prevent them from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're asking the second, the trainer's response depends on the trainer. Some continue to fight. (I would assume most. If their goal is to become a master, it's a loss they learn to deal with. Not that they become emotionless, but they learn to remember and move on and fight in their honor etc.) Some would possibly stop because they don't want to lose more people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This can be seen as something similar to when people command a division in any kind of combat. You either continue to fight when you've lost a man, or you discover that kind of stress is too much for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's always theories &lt;a href=&quot;http://ds.about.com/od/Pokemon/a/Did-Garys-Raticate-Really-Die-In-Pokemon-Red-And-Blue.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; that go over whether Red kills his rival's Raticate. This implies that pokemon CAN die and have died, with your rival being an example of someone who continues on anyway. And with a city like Lavender Town and the cemetery and the natural effect of aging (since there are baby pokemon), you can reasonably assume most pokemon can die of old age and, therefore, other causes of bodily deterioration/harm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps out some.

Iyashikei aims to heal the viewer through delivering a sense of relaxation and catharsis. This is accomplished through a tranquil – though not necessarily happy – in-show experience which allows the viewer to calm their mind and relax by focusing more on the emotional experience than on the intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The essay gives several examples of &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; shows, including Aria, K-On, Mushishi, and Non Non Biyori.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my meager explorations of Japanese literature, I've noticed a peaceful and sometimes pensive feeling similar to the tone of many &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt;, especially in the poetry.

I could well be convinced otherwise, though!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Unlike obscenity, you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; know (old) &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; when you see it&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, here's the problem, as I see it. &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; is one of those things that is characterized less by the content of a work and more by the &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; of that work upon its audience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, content creators have a well-worn library of narrative approaches that they can use to make their work &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot;), and so we can look at a present-day work and see how it uses these approaches to effectively &quot;heal&quot; the audience. Alternatively, we can look at how a work comports itself relative to &quot;canonically&quot; &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; works that it discourses with, like &lt;em&gt;Aria&lt;/em&gt; and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when we look at works that predate the &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; &quot;canon&quot; and its associated library of approaches, how do we effectively evaluate whether a work is or is not &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt;? Based on how it makes you feel, I guess.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#xA; But that doesn't help us come up with a good answer to &quot;which was the first?&quot;. That's the issue - it's simply rather difficult to say what is or is not &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; the further into the past you go. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;For example:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I strongly disagree with the reddit user's claim that &lt;em&gt;Only Yesterday&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is, on the whole, a calm and relaxing movie, and happens to employ some of the narrative trappings common to modern &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; works (wistfulness for rural Japan, in particular), it pairs these elements with decidedly un-healing bits, like the various mishaps Taeko experiences during her childhood, and the obstacles she faces in her budding relationship with Toshio. It is a beautiful slice of Japanese life, but is it healing? No, at least not to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we lifted &lt;em&gt;Only Yesterday&lt;/em&gt; out of 1991 and released it for the first time in 2016, would we call it &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt;? I don't think so. It is not, in my view, substantially in discourse with the modern &quot;&lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; canon&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why is &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; a Thing, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's something of an argument that the crystallization of &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; in the late 90s as a Thing (throughout Japanese media; not just in the otaku realm) is a direct response to the trouble Japan was experiencing at the time - the bubble had just burst, and Japan was really reeling for the first time since World War II. This explanation is pretty reductive, and it'd be silly to claim that the economy is the only (or even primary) cause, but it seems uncontroversial that Japan's national woes at the time did contribute to the reification of &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taken out of its context as a response to the Japanese zeitgeist of the 90s, does it even make sense to talk about &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt;? I'm not sure that it does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;A long, rambling footnote&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is not to say that it is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; impossible to identify a work as having a quality that was only effectively delinated after the work's creation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the realm of gothic fiction. When Walpole wrote &lt;em&gt;The Castle of Otranto&lt;/em&gt;, he wrote the first gothic novel, even though he could not have known that, since the idea of gothic fiction as a distinct thing did not come about until some years later. But we can nonetheless distinctly see that &lt;em&gt;Otranto&lt;/em&gt; is a gothic novel (never mind the fact that the whole genre is named for &lt;em&gt;Otranto&lt;/em&gt; to begin with), because there are specific narrative trappings that characterize gothic fiction (spooky castles, fantastic romances, etc.), and &lt;em&gt;Otranto&lt;/em&gt; exhibits them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;iyashikei&lt;/em&gt; works are not characterized by their narrative in this same way. Where, on the one hand, you have the (admittedly large) cluster of &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; anime, you also have &quot;man has mystical encounters with spiritual entities&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Natsume Yuujinchou&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mushishi&lt;/em&gt;) and &quot;parenting is great&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Usagi Drop&lt;/em&gt;, timeskip notwithstanding) and &quot;shibe does shibe things&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Itoshi no Muco&lt;/em&gt;) and &quot;whatever &lt;em&gt;Glasslip&lt;/em&gt; is&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Glasslip&lt;/em&gt;), and I don't know how to identify a coherent commonality among all these things besides &quot;they make me feel fuzzy inside&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1908" LastActivityDate="2016-05-18T08:46:21.563" CommentCount="4" />

Karin Ogino, the voice of Aoi, tends to spit out whatever is on her mind without much thought.

But it was not the exact results they were trying for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember it was pointed out that the name of the ritual is actually the system the ritual is based off of. It was also pointed out that there are many different things this system is capable of. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also know that Suzuka was forced to study the ritual further to either verify what all was known about it or to try and learn more about it. I'm leaning more towards the possibility that it was both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way we now know for sure that not everything is known about this ritual. Soi would say when he revived Natsume he did the same thing the omniyo agency did when they performed it. Which means he revived her as a familiar. But she doesn't have a master thus making her a rogue familiar and not a living spirit like it is explained. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now before anyone says she is one and they say she is in the story let's remember a few things. Hokuto was a familiar. Hokuto was used to bind Natsume's spirit. Logically that would mean Natsume is now a familiar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following this vein of thought I have the belief that because she is a familiar without a master her spirit is unstable and will be until she A. dies B.gets a master or C. Harutora finds a way to separate hokuto from Natsume's without destroying the bond that is keeping her alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is what I came up with to explain how the ritual could &quot;kinda work&quot; when Natsume is now alive but having trouble staying stable enough to live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24196" LastActivityDate="2016-05-21T08:09:29.793" CommentCount="1" />

Nisa calmed Lady White Heart down but when the people she was chasing thanked Nisa while at the same time making fun of her chest size (calling her pimple nipples if i recall) prompting Nisa to do a 180 and aid Lady White Heart to kill them (not sure if they were killed or just badly beaten).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;another substory involved Lady Blanc and Noire both going to a convention in Lastation and seeing one another but not recognizing each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Story Arcs&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of the game mechanic in the original game where you could only traverse between continents when they were close the plot was broken up to be played in almost any order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;before getting the Keyfragment each nation had 2 Arcs. i says 2 because Leanbox was 2 distinctive plots but when i played i first went to Lastation and was forced to stop helping Chian and then went to Lowee (the continent cloest at the time) and was forced to stop that until i did Leanbox's first arc before returning to Lastion and getting the Keyfragment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastions 2 Arcs were more or less the same with Avanir taking over Lastion, Noire feigning amnesia to lean why Neptune was there, helping Chian for the expo and fighting the CPU Breaker Avanir created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't remember much of Lowee's Arcs but i think it was still similar as the CG on Blanc with a book in Re;Birth is also in the original game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the first arc of Leanbox in the original game was more or less the same minus Vert joining the party and getting a Keyfragment. the second Arc was about Vert working her hardest to earn back the faith of her people after being lazy in the first Arc however was overheating alot (the X-Box 360 Overheating Problems when it was released) and being rescued by Neptune's Team (primary because IF was worried).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Quartet Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the original game each weapon was on each continent but broken into 4, found at the end of 4 different dungeons which were all &quot;kill the boss at the end&quot; types so you had to go through 16 dungeons before being able to get to Celestia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also after remaking the 4 weapons Neptune leaves the party in an attempt to face Arfoire alone (having regained her memories) forcing IF, Compa, Gust and Nisa to fight her when they try and stop her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in Re;Birth the weapons aren't broken and get remade into weapons that better suit the CPU. this also means that the CPUs didn't force the weapons into their sockets. also in the Original game the gateway worked so there was no need for the party to get the Basilicon's help&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also in the original game the acquisition of these weapons didn't coincide with each nation having to deal with Fake CPUs and thus Lady Blanc's 3 sizes was never blurted out during a quiz&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Guild&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in the original game the Guide was made up of people who were born in one nation but worshiped another's CPU. generally these people were looked down upon by others so IF's affiliation with the Guide was kept hidden for much of the game&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CPU's joining&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in the original game the CPU's were optional, only required to get the True End. in order to get them using Gust's hidden ability to show the national share levels one needed to increase the shares for one nation in order to trigger an event which lead to Neptune, Compa and IF fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;IF x Vert&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IF's and Vert's relationship is much more expanded on in Re;Birth than it is in the original game, most likely because of how the CPU's are optional. in Re;Birth we see events such as Vert joining the party when they leave Leanbox stating she can't live without her Iffy, Vert using IF as her &quot;warmer&quot; in Lowee (placing the warmers IF gave her in her endowments before returning to her Iffy) and IF &quot;dying&quot; when everyone tried to fit into the portal device to transport them to Celestia with Vert, purposely, squeezing in with IF and smoothing her within her breasts. (to be honest i loved all these Shoujo Ai/Yuri moments between them. great improvement)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Overlord Momus&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the original game Overload Momus did not exists, same same in Re;Birth, however Arfoire never creates it. instead spreads the rumor that the CPU's fled Celestia when Overlord Momus appeared and destroyed it while also spreading news that the Overlord would descend from Celestia and the CPU's, now weakened, will not be able to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Re;Birth Overload Momus takes the form of CFW.Arfoire from &lt;em&gt;Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk. II&lt;/em&gt; (and i assume Re;Birth 2 as from what i have seen i don't see that the plot has changed), the form of the Deity of Sin Afoire takes when ASIC succeeds in resuecting her&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/F7LiJ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/F7LiJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;CFW.Afoire&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DOS.Afoire, the Deity of Sin's true form, also appears in Re;Birth as a couple of Colosseum battles such as Delphinus (who too appeared in Mk. II's Colosseum as a palette swap of of DOS.Afoire however was a different pallet swap to Re;Birth's Delphinus)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Afoire&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in the original game it's revealed that Afoire was the True Goddess until she got tired of the job and split her power, and Gamindustri into 4, creating the CPUs and giving full control of the world to Histoire. later however she wanted it all back and reclaim her spot as the True Goddess and turned on Histoire and sparked the Console Wars so she could reclaim her powers from the CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in Re;Birth it's revealed that Afoire was just a regular human who fought along side the Hero Quartet when they fought the True Goddess who was evil. when the True Goddess was defeated her power was split into 4 and Arfoire raised the CPUs herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is also initially suspected that Arfoire was corrupted by the True Goddess's power she copied from her during the battle and sought to become the new True Goddess however in Re;Birth's true end Nepture suspected that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Arfoire wanted to become the True Goddess so she could better raise the CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Endings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 2 Endings, Normal and True, also are different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Original Game&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never got the Normal Ending in the original game however compared to Re;Birth's normal ending i can assume they would be different as one of the requirements of the True End in the original game was having all the CPU's (shares didn't count)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; After defeating Afoire and escaping Celestia the CPU's realize they still have alot of work to do as Afoire's Enemy Disks are still active and all over the world. in order to make their job easier they sacrifice their HDDs making them regular humans and ridding the world of monsters for good&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Re;Birth&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Afoire is defeated and Histoire visits each nations to see how the CPUs are doing finishing with Planeptune where she joins Neptune, Compa and IF in eating pudding&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Afoire is defeated but tries to destroy Celestia. with the CPU's exhausted everyone goes to flee yet Neptune remains hoping to save Afoire with everyone having escaped but prays for Afoire to be saved too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Year later Histoire states that while everyone escaped Celestia was suspected to have been destroyed in the explosion, Neptune and Afoire with it, as the gateway no longer worked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;after visiting the other nations to see how the CPUs were doing she visits Planeptune. while IF and Compa are talking about Neptune, low and behold Neptune falls through Compa's roof revealing that Celestia wasn't destroyed but instead just the gateway and that she fell from the sky because she was flying around in HDD and got hungry and reverted back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neptune also introduces Afoire who was saved (and looks very different now not looking like some witch). Afoire apologies to Histoire about the trouble she has caused and voes to make up for it until the end of her life while Compa and IF warmly welcomes Neptune home&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The CPU Candidates&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;if one got the Shares up to a certain level for Planeptune, Lastation and Lowee they can get plans to unlock Nepgear, Uni, Ram and Rom. to actually unlock them one had to get the items and the shares to 35% for the CPU Candidate's nation (which stills fall into the requirements for Re;Birth's True End which is 0% for Other Shares and all 4 nations having atleast 20%). following their unlocks there is a scene which Histoire says that they are born from the accumulation of shares with each CPU posting on their blogs about their new sister(s) (with Vert expressing how she's depressed that she didn't get one but will still work hard for Leanbox)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;since i never got the normal ending in Re;Birth with any of the CPU Candidates unlocked i can only assume their appearance in the normal end is similar to the True End in which it appeared their small segment are injected in the scene with some differences as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; with Nepgear she has taken over her sister's work since Neptune didn't return from Celestia&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;however how the world is formed in Re;Birth still makes it incompatible with the 2nd Hyperdimension shown in the other Re;Birth games and &lt;em&gt;Megadimension Neptunia VII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1587" LastEditorUserId="1587" LastEditDate="2016-05-03T07:48:47.800" LastActivityDate="2016-05-03T07:48:47.800" CommentCount="1" />

Still others, such as Full Metal Alchemist 2003, run four cours, or about 51 episodes.

If it took too long, then he won't survive. The reasons are as follow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The titan would keep eating other humans, thus human bodies would come raining down on the already eaten human, potentially injuring them. If injured then his chance of surviving would get even lower due to the panic the injury caused him and the injury potentially hindering him from avoiding the next batch of dead bodies which could injure him even further.

If it is not, then being in the liquid itself would hinder his movement, which would disable him from avoiding dead bodies raining down on him as the titan eat more humans.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It was shown that after eating humans, titan would vomit them back since they lack digestive organs.

But since the world government we going for a hunting spree for any book or memory about the void century, the King decided to move his capital city to its current position and leave the other poneglyph in the desert where no one will find it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22127" LastActivityDate="2016-05-14T07:35:07.787" CommentCount="0" />

But even if we say Ikoma wasn't the first one with these ideas, why isn't anybody else using this technology?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3820" LastEditorUserId="8486" LastEditDate="2016-05-18T10:58:47.213" LastActivityDate="2016-05-21T17:33:30.367" Title="How come Mumei's pistols can kill Kabane?"
